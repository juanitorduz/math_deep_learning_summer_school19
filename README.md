## TensorFlow 2.0 Tutorial

During the summer school we are having hands on practive on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org). The material can be found on the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/clonker/bms-summerschool19-tf](https://github.com/clonker/bms-summerschool19-tf). 

**REMARK**: Most of the experiments in this repository are based on the tutorial mentioned above. I extended some parts for my personal clarification
